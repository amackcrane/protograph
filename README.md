# protograph

## Setup

* install [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases)
* ensure you have python3
* put the repo somewhere on your filesystem
* edit the 'pg' script to point 'path' variable to the local repo
  * note no spaces around '=' in bash
* copy 'pg' to somewhere on the search path, like /usr/local/bin on unix or \Windows\system32 on windows
* install python libraries
  * pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  
I'm hoping this will work on windows with git bash or similar, but haven't tried it.
